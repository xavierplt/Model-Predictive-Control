# ü§ñ Non-Linear Model Predictive Control (MPC) for Mobile Manipulator

## üåü Overview

This project presents the modeling and implementation of a **Non-Linear Model Predictive Control (NMPC)** system for a mobile manipulator (mobile base + robotic arm) with explicit **anti-collision constraints**. The controller is designed to achieve a target position while dynamically avoiding multiple static obstacles.

This work serves as a high-level demonstrator of non-linear control and optimization techniques.

## üß† Methodology and Modeling

### 1. System State and Control Inputs

The system state vector $\mathbf{x}$ and the control input vector $\mathbf{u}$ were defined for the non-linear discrete-time model.

* **State $\mathbf{x}$:** Includes the pose of the mobile base and the joint positions of the manipulator (e.g., $[x, y, \theta, q_1, q_2, \dots]^T$).
* **Input $\mathbf{u}$:** Control velocities (e.g., $[\dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{\theta}, \dot{q}_1, \dots]^T$).

### 2. Anti-Collision Constraints

Collision avoidance is implemented by projecting the manipulator's links (modeled as specific points $P_0, P_1, \dots$) and ensuring their distance from the center of static circular obstacles ($O_i$) remains above a safe margin $R_{\text{safety}}$.

$$||\mathbf{P}_j(\mathbf{x}) - \mathbf{O}_i||_2 \geq R_{\text{safety}}$$

### 3. Cost Function Analysis

The project compares two objective functions ($J_1$ and $J_2$), both aiming to minimize the distance to the target and the energy of the control inputs, but differing in how they handle path smoothing and constraint violation weighting.

* **Key Finding (from the M2 Report):**
    * $J_2$ converges faster in paths requiring **significant obstacle avoidance**.
    * $J_1$ is **more efficient and faster** for shorter paths **without complex obstacle maneuvers** and tends to be more precise overall.

## üìä Trajectory Results (Obstacle Avoidance Scenario)

The implementation successfully demonstrates the MPC's ability to plan a collision-free path by dynamically adjusting the control inputs over the prediction horizon $N_p$.

The image below illustrates the path planned by the MPC for the manipulator's links, navigating around four distinct circular obstacles.



**Visualization Note:** The dashed lines represent the anti-collision constraint circles. The colored solid lines represent the planned trajectory of the mobile manipulator's specific links.
